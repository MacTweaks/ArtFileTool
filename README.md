The images that you see on the computer screen and interact with as an application are based on collections of image files whch form the Graphical User Interface, these files are located in various folders scattered across the system files but the majority are located in just two files, SArtFile.bin and ArtFile.bin, but these files can't be opened without first being decoded. A programmer named Alex Zielenski wrote two programs which can decode the .bin files and output their contents as images which can be opened in an image editor such as Inkspace or Adobe Illustrator and modified.
